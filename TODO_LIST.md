## NOTES

- The current implementation has a solid foundation with working authentication and user management
- **Backend integration is fully functional** with complete data pipeline from loadcell sensors to Flutter frontend
- **Real-time data streaming works end-to-end** via WebSocket connection
- **Frontend can control backend operations** (start/stop tests, data collection)
- **User role system is working correctly**: 
  - **Home page users** = **Admin role** (automatic assignment)
  - **Admin dashboard created users** = **Regular user role** (for testing)
  - **Jesper credentials** = **Demo placeholder** (shown on login page for quick testing)
- **Logout functionality is working** with both header button and dedicated button
- **IoT dashboard has been completely removed** and replaced with proper test selection flow
- Device setup and connectivity is fully documented and validated across all platforms (Android, iOS, simulators)
- Cross-platform development environment is properly configured and tested
- The main missing pieces are data visualization, IMTP analysis algorithms, and data export functionality
